Python script to process and manipulate CSV files


Assignment 1: Build a CSV Processing Service
Objective: Write a Python script to process and manipulate CSV files.

Task:
Create a Python script that takes a CSV file as input and processes the data (e.g., adding or removing columns, sorting data based on a specific column, filtering rows).
Output the processed data to a new CSV file.
Steps:
Write a Python script csvprocessor.py that:
Reads an input CSV file.
Adds a new column Total by summing two other columns.
Filters rows based on a condition (e.g., values greater than a threshold).
Writes the processed data to a new CSV file.
Bonus: Handle edge cases like empty rows, invalid data, or missing columns.




Objective:
Write a Python script that:

Takes a CSV file as input.
Adds a new column by summing two other columns.
Filters rows based on a condition (e.g., values greater than a threshold).
Outputs the processed data to a new CSV file.
Steps:
Read the Input CSV File: Use the csv module to read the data from the file.
Add a New Column: Sum the values from two specific columns and add a new column (Total).
Filter Rows: Implement logic to filter rows based on a condition (e.g., filter out rows where the sum of the two columns is below a certain threshold).
Write the Output CSV File: After processing, write the modified data to a new CSV file.
